# Programming Language

For the frontend of our project, we are using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a structured, visually appealing, and interactive user experience. These languages provide the flexibility and functionality needed to develop a responsive and efficient project management system while ensuring ease of maintenance and scalability.

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML serves as the backbone of our frontend, defining the structure and content of our web pages. Its universal support across all browsers makes it the ideal choice for creating a solid foundation. Additionally, its semantic elements improve accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO), ensuring clarity and organization. Since HTML integrates seamlessly with CSS and JavaScript, it allows us to build a structured yet dynamic user interface.

- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is essential for styling and designing the layout of our application. It enables us to create a clean, modern, and responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility across various devices. By utilizing reusable styles and potential frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS, we streamline development while maintaining consistency in the user interface.

- JavaScript
JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to our web pages. It allows us to implement features such as form validation, real-time updates, and interactive task management. Through event handling and asynchronous updates, JavaScript ensures a seamless user experience by dynamically updating content without requiring full page reloads. Its cross-browser compatibility further ensures that our application runs smoothly across different platforms.
