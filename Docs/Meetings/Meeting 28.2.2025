- We have decided to start working on some more concrete things
- Frontend Team has made a couple of pages and has distributed the tasks that they have 
- Backend team is still deciding what to do for the languages and such because we are a little lost
- Felipe made the Github and organized it a little bit but it still needs work
- Raveen made the project charter and some of the documents we have to give by first submission
- We want to separate some tasks for the Backend team but we need to have a clearer idea of what to do for it.
